This repository contains the SQL code and Tableau visualization for the Maven Pizza Challenge, which can be found [here](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-pizza-challenge).

## Overview

The Maven Pizza Challenge is a data analysis challenge from Maven Analytics that focuses on pizza sales data. In this project, I used PostgreSQL to answer specific questions related to the challenge and then visualized the analysis using Tableau.
